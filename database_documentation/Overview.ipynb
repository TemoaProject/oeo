    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the documentation for the Temoa input database used to produce the Open Energy Outlook (OEO) for the United States. [Temoa](https://temoacloud.com/) is an energy system optimization model, and thus performs capacity expansion of energy technologies across the whole energy system - fuel supply, electricity, transport, buildings and industry - over several future decades. This documentation is meant to provide a thorough explanation of the how technologies, commodities, and end-use demands are represented within the model, and also serves as a data repository and benchmark for other modeling efforts. Note that modeling such a complex system over several decades requires simplifications in order to make the model tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the level of detail in our database with other modeling efforts, be sure to ask yourself the following questions:\n",
    "1. What research questions is the model trying to answer?\n",
    "2. Does the model cover the whole energy system or a particular sector?\n",
    "3. Does the model perform capacity expansion over future years or does it focus on a single time period or operational issues given an existing capacity mix?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Open Energy Outlook, our [Roadmap](https://github.com/TemoaProject/oeo/blob/master/OEO_Roadmap.md) lays out the research questions we are planning to address. Addressing these questions requires consideration of three critical issues in the development of the model input database: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and the level of technology detail, as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial resolution.** Regional differences in fuel supply, renewable resources, end-use demands, and existing capacities are an important determinant of how the future US energy system may evolve. While it would be useful to model all 50 states, particularly so we can capture state-level energy and climate policies, such a spatial resolution would be computational infeasible, given the other modeling requirements. Thus we need to aggregate states into regions. One of the critical challenges in choosing regions is the electric sector representation, where balancing authorities do not neatly follow state lines. Using [PowerGenome](https://github.com/PowerGenome/PowerGenome), we experimented with the aggregation of balancing authorities into regions that largely follow state boundaries, while still capturing the variations in supply and demand across the country. More details are given the electric power section of this document. Figure 1 shows the regions in the database, based on state-level aggregations, while Table 1 provides the definition of each region.\n",

    "**Temporal resolution.** While the focus of energy systems modeling is on energy systems development over several decades, operational issues associated with electricity system dispatch are important to capture. The ability to adequately model electric power operation and dispatch is particularly important when considering systems that have a high penetration of renewable energy. Our base year is 2020, and the model has five-year time periods that extend to 2050. Each year within a given 5-year time period is assumed to be identical, and thus the model optimizes a representative year within each model time period. In order to capture operational issues and balance supply and demand at the sub-annual level, each representative year is broken down into a number of user-defined time slices. Those time slices can be defined as large blocks of time; for example, \"summer - day\", or at highly granular level; for example, hourly or sub-hourly resolution. Given our interest in modeling high renewables penetration, the brute force approach would suggest modeling every hour of the year for all future years in the projection, but such an approach is computationally infeasible. Thus we need a more clever approach. In this database, we use a \"representative days\" approach where several days, modeled at an hourly resolution, are used to represent an entire year's operations. These representative days are selected from annual datasets that include energy demands as well as wind and solar capacity factors using k-means clustering, as described in [Mallapragada et al, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.015) for the electricity sector, and implemented in [PowerGenome](https://github.com/PowerGenome/PowerGenome). Further details on the clustering approach are presented in the Electric Sector section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temoa is often solved in \"perfect foresight\" mode, where all decision variables corresponding to installed capacity and commodity flows are optimized simultaneously across all future time periods. To increase the number of representative days that can be modeled, we have developed a \"myopic\" mode for Temoa, whereby the user can solve a subset of future time periods at once. For example, it is possible to solve only the 2020-2025 time periods, retain the 2020 results, optimize the 2025-2030 results, retain the 2025 results, etc. Such a myopic approach conveys two advantages. First, by splitting one large capacity expansion problem into a series of smaller ones, the problem becomes more computationally tractable, and allows us to increase the number of representative days in the model. Second, a myopic approach is more realistic, as it provides limited look ahead rather than the \"crystal ball\" associated with perfect foresight runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database used to produce the Open Energy Outlook has a time horizon that spans 2020 to 2050, with 5-year time periods. While we are still performing computational tests with different numbers of representative days, we expect that the eventual database will include between 4 and 12 representative days over which supply and demand are balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technology detail.** Energy system optimization models like Temoa represent technologies as a set of processes connected within a system by commodity flows. Technologies are represented by a set of engineering-economic parameters, including capital cost, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs, conversion efficiencies, and emissions coefficients. The strength of models such as Temoa resides in their ability to capture these detailed cost and performance characteristics. While high granularity in technology representation can be an asset, unnecessary detail degrades computational performance and makes the model harder to interrogate. Across the sectors modeled in this project, we have applied expert judgement and articulated our assumptions regarding technology representation. The descriptions embedded in the following sections lay our our assumptions in detail, and are guided by the thinking laid out in our [Roadmap](https://github.com/TemoaProject/oeo/blob/master/OEO_Roadmap.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the input database, we model the following sectors: fuel supply, electricity, industry, buildings, and transportation. Because the database represents the whole energy system, energy commodities flow between technologies in different sectors, linking the entire system together in one large network. An example pathway associated with renewable electricity generation is shown in Figure 2."

For instance, “E_SOLPVCEN” represents utility-scale solar PV, and “C_SH_AHP_ELC” represents electric air-cooled heat pumps used for space heating in the commercial sector. As noted above, the “E” and “C” at the beginning of the names denote the sector to which the technology belongs. A full description of all the names are provided in the “technologies” table of the database. Technologies with an “EA” and “BLND” designation are used to facilitate emissions accounting and blending of separate fuels, respectively.\n",

Existing technologies have an “R” (i.e., \"residual\") while new technologies are shown by “N” (i.e., \"new\"). For example, “E_SOLPVCEN_R” and “C_SH_AHP_ELC_N” refer to existing (residual) utility-scale PV plants and new electric air-cooled heat pumps used for space heating in the commercial sector, respectively."
