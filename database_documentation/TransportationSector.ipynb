    "\n",
    "The modeled transport modes are light-duty vehicles, trucks, buses, rail passenger, rail freight, subways, aviation, marine, and off-highway. The demands, efficiencies, and costs for these transport modes are largely drawn from the USEPA9r database [(Shay et al., 2013)](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryID=150883) out to 2050 and can be met by various technologies. To access the input workbooks from the USPA9r database, contact Carol Lenox (lenox.carol@epa.gov). We've made significant updates to this dataset, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transportation sector in the OEO database can be split into three categories: light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles.  Light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicle technology names in the database start with T_LDV, T_MDV, or T_HDV, respectively. Demand commodity names follow the format TMD(L,M,H)DV_. For example, small SUV (SS) demand is represented as TMDLDV_SS, where TMD stands for transportation miles demanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent seven light-duty vehicle size classes, outlined in [Section 1.1](#light-duty-vehicles). We externally constrain the percent of end-use demand met by each size class. As Temoa optimizes for the least-cost solution, without this constraint, the model would deploy only cheap, fuel efficient minicars and compact cars. We base size-class demand distributions on the MARKAL USEPA9r database [(Shay et al., 2013)](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryID=150883).\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium-duty vehicles consist only of medium-duty trucks, corresponding to class 6 and 7 trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy-duty vehicles include heavy trucks, buses, passenger and freight rail, aviation, marine vessels, and off-highway vehicles. Each transportation technology meets a separate, exogenously specified end-use demand.  Depending on the technology, the demand may be in ton-miles, passenger-miles, or vehicle-miles traveled. Temoa does not currently allow for modal switching. For example, a long-haul truck cannot meet the same freight demand as a train; rather, the two have distinct exogenously defined demand profiles. Existing work shows that modal switching is one effective means of reducing transportation energy consumption, and we hope to incorporate modal models into the Temoa framework in the future [(Kaack et al, 2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aad56c/meta).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We define technology-specific discount rates, or hurdle rates, for some technologies. Hurdle rates allow the modeler to account for consumer preferences otherwise ignored in a least-cost optimization model [2]. In the light-duty vehicle sector, we assume that conventional and hybrid gasoline-fueled vehicles (excluding plug-in hybrid vehicles) have a 5% hurdle rate, equal to the model's global discount rate, and all other powertrains have a 7.5% discount rate. For heavy-duty vehicles, conventional technologies have a 5% discount rate and alternative-fueled vehicles have a 10% discount rate."

    "Modeled truck technologies include heavy-duty short-haul, heavy-duty long-haul, medium-duty, and commercial.  In previous versions of the EPA database, heavy-duty trucking was split into short-haul and long-haul. This convention changed with v20.1.0; now the database only represents heavy-duty trucks in aggregate. The current OEO database retains a distinction between short- and long-haul heavy trucks, as the availability of low carbon technology differs between the two categories. As such, the techno-economic parameters are taken from an older version of the database (v18.1.4). This older version did not include electric trucks. The characterization of electric short-haul heavy-duty trucks (T_HDV_THSELC_N) is based on technoeconomic parameters from [NREL’s electrification futures study (EFS)](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70485.pdf). The parameters match those for NREL’s “Heavy Duty BEV short-range” and are an average of the medium-, slow-, and rapid-advancement scenarios. Heavy-duty short-haul trucks are assumed to travel 27,390 miles per year, in accordance with EPA MARKAL’s assumptions for annual vehicle miles traveled (vmt). \n",

    "Heavy-duty long-haul truck cost and efficiency parameters are taken from the International Council on Clean Transportation and include characterization of hydrogen fuel cell and LNG long-haul trucks. We assume the average long-haul truck travels 79,520 miles per year, again based on EPA MARKAL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to heavy-duty short-haul trucks, commercial truck efficiencies match v18.1.4 of the EPA databases save for electric trucks, which are drawn from NREL’s EFS. In this case, commercial trucks have the same technoeconomic parameters as NREL’s 300-mile range light-duty BEV truck [(NREL EFS)](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70485.pdf).

    "#### 1.3.1 Marine shipping <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"marine\"></a>\n",
    "When modeling marine options, it is important to distinguish important characteristics of particular vessel types, such as annual ton-miles (or passenger-miles) traveled and engine power, and also to ensure that decarbonization options are adequately represented. For example, [Minnehan and Pratt (2017)](https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SAND2017-12665.pdf) note that passenger ferries may be able to operate on a battery, gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and methanol, while a large containership’s decarbonization options are more limited. The heavy-duty shipping sector includes passenger vessels as well as five freight vessel types: container ships, liquid bulk ships, general cargo ships, tugboats, and offshore supply vessels. These classifications are drawn from the annual publication of Waterborne Transportation Lines of the United States by the Institute for Water Resources (IWR), which provides data on the number of vessels, horsepower, and cargo or passenger capacity of U.S. flagged vessels [(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Institute for Water Resources)](https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16021coll2/id/3796/). The current OEO database uses only U.S. flagged vessels, and demand is only for domestic cargo and passenger transport. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the technical parameters for each vessel type were taken from the [European Environment Agency’s (EEA’s) Guidebook](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-guidebook-2019) for International Maritime and Inland Navigation, National Navigation, National Fishing, and Recreational Boats. The EEA provides emission factors (EFs), average engine power ratings, average fuel consumption, and average load factor for multiple ship types. While EEA gives technical parameters for passenger vessels, their characterization includes large international cruise ships, which skews the estimate significantly. The IWR provides data on the main engine power rating for vessels in the domestic fleet; this data is used to determine the main engine power for domestic passenger vessels. The EEA estimates are used for freight vessels, as the process of pulling vessel engine characteristics from the IWR document for thousands of domestic vessels is time-consuming. Excel spreadsheets exist, but to our knowledge, the workbooks do not include vessel classification (e.g., offshore supply vessel, cargo), meaning individual vessels would have to be matched with their classification from the PDF report. This effort will be considered for future work. The IWR does not provide an estimate of auxiliary engine power, but the EEA estimates the ratio of auxiliary engine power to main engine power by ship type. This estimate is used to determine an approximate auxiliary engine power for passenger vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For freight shipping, the total annual ton-miles traveled per vessel per year are estimated using an EPA workbook that pulls data from Lloyd’s register Fairplay as well as several literature studies [R.

    "Specific fuel consumption for each vessel type is found by multiplying the sfc for each engine type by the percent of vessels with that engine type and summing over all combinations of engine and fuel.

According to the [EEA guidebook](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/emep-eea-guidebook-2019), when cruising, the LF is 0.8 and at berth it is 0.2 (except for liquid bulk ships, for which it is 0.1). We also assume that the efficiency of new ships increases in the future. The [Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Greenhouse-Gas-Studies-2014.aspx) defines two efficiency improvement scenarios. The first assumes a 60% efficiency improvement in 2050 relative to 2012 levels and the second assumes a 40% efficiency improvement. We conservatively assume the latter, implementing it as a 5% efficiency improvement in every 5-year time period starting in 2020.\n",

    "We base hydrogen vessel feasibility estimates on [Minnehan and Pratt (2017)](https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SAND2017-12665.pdf), which find that the majority of vessel classes are capable of running on liquefied hydrogen. Of the thirteen existing vessels considered in their analysis, they found ten would be able to run on liquid hydrogen based on voyage distance and mass and volume limitations. These vessels included a container ship, a general cargo ship, an offshore supply vessel, and a bulk cargo ship. Therefore, we define all freight shipping technologies with a liquid hydrogen option except tugboats, which were not considered in the study. Furthermore, a [2020 ICCT report](https://theicct.org/publications/zero-emission-container-corridor-hydrogen-2020) found that 99% of voyages made along the international shipping corridor between the San Pedro Bay and the Pearl River Delta could be fueled by hydrogen. We assume hydrogen ships will be available by 2030, based on an estimate from Flexport, according to an [NPR report](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/716693006/the-dawn-of-low-carbon-shipping#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Container%20ships%20and%20other%20maritime%20vessels%20currently%20run%20on%20pollutant,new%20fuels%20such%20as%20hydrogen). This is likely a conservative estimate, as some European countries plan to deploy hydrogen ships as early as 2021 ([see this article](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/flagships-project-gets-usd-5-6-mn-for-two-hydrogen-fueled-ships/#:~:text=Flagships%20Project%20Gets%20USD%205.6%20Mn%20for%20Two%20Hydrogen%2DFueled%20Ships,-Business%20%26%20Finance&text=The%20European%20innovation%20project%20Flagships,vessels%20in%20France%20and%20Norway.)).  To calculate vessel efficiencies, we use a slightly simplified version of the method outlined above. We use a single value for specific fuel consumption, taken from [Raucci  (2017)](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1539941/), rather than a weighted average. Otherwise, the calculation methodology is the same.\n",

    "Efficiency calculations for passenger vessels deviate from the EEA methodology as the EEA report includes large ocean-going cruise ships in their passenger vessel classification. The IWR reports only one such vessel in the US merchant fleet, so EEA values are not appropriate. Passenger vessel efficiency is based on [Cottrell (2011)](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/4/2/239), whose work compared US ferry boat efficiencies to highway bridges crossing the same body of water. Cottrell’s work gives passenger-miles per gallon for eight ferry vessel companies operating 96 marine gasoil-powered ferries. Using this data yields an average efficiency of 0.092 billion passenger miles traveled per PJ. To benchmark both passenger and freight vessel efficiencies, as well as demand estimates, we compare total energy consumption for domestic shipping from our calculations to Annual Energy Outlook forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t consider hydrogen-powered passenger vessels, but model electric passenger vessels based on the E-Ferry, an electric ferry currently operating in Southern Denmark. Based on energy consumption data from an EU-sponsored evaluation report on the E-Ferry, efficiency is found to be 0.165 billion passenger miles per PJ.\n",

    "This equation is taken from the [Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Greenhouse-Gas-Studies-2014.aspx), which includes the constant 0.98 as approximately 98% of fuel sulfur is converted to gaseous SO2. As of January 1, 2015, ships inside a sulfur emissions control area must use fuel or an equivalently strict emissions control technology that limits emissions to less than or equal to 0.1% m/m (that is, mass of pollutant by mass of fuel) [(Sulphur oxides (SOx) – Regulation 14)](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/Sulphur-oxides-(SOx)-%E2%80%93-Regulation-14.aspx). To meet sulfur requirements, ships can use residual fuel oil (RFO) with a scrubber, marine gasoil (MGO), or an alternative fuel such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or hydrogen [(Zis et al., 2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2549-05?journalCode=trra).  Additionally, ships must meet nitrogen oxide standards based on their construction date (see Table 9). It is assumed here that all existing vintages meet Tier II standards while new builds meet Tier III standards and that all vessels meet the sulfur standard, since it was implemented before the model’s first time period (2017). To meet NOx requirements, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technologies can be retrofitted onto vessels or alternative fuels may be used [(Jonge et al., 2005a)](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_nox.pdf). For simplicity, we assume that all vessels using MGO are equipped with SCR technology and all vessels using RFO are equipped both with a scrubber and SCR. Relevant assumptions for emission factor calculations are that scrubbers reduce SO2 by 75% and PM by 25% from the ship and engine type baseline and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reduces NOx by 90% [(Jonge et al., 2005a](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_nox.pdf); [Jonge et al., 2005b)](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pdf/task2_so2.pdf).\n",

Specifically, the study estimates transportation-related service demands, as shown in Table 11, primarily by downscaling service demands data from the US EIA 2017 Annual Energy Outlook and the NEMS model. We draw transportation service demands primarily from EFS.

The distribution of demand and existing capacity by vehicle type is drawn from <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=278925\" rel=\"nofollow\">EPA MARKAL</a> and is assumed to be the same region-to-region and stay constant across the model’s time horizon. \n",

In line with MARKAL, we assume that 41% of vmt demand is met by short-haul vehicles and that 59% is met by long-haul vehicles in each time period. Following EPA MARKAL’s convention, we assume that all existing long-haul trucks are fueled by diesel. Therefore, all other heavy-truck capacity in EFS (CNG, E10, LPG) is assumed to be short-haul. \n",

Similar to EFS, this dataset projects annual demand in ton-miles traveled by state. FAF does not report a 2017 demand value, so we assume that existing capacity is equivalent to 2012 demand. The FAF does not project out to 2050; projections stop at 2045. We calculate the average five-year growth rate from 2020 to 2045 and apply it to 2045 to estimate 2050 demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aviation\n",
    "EFS models only one demand for aviation, but we follow MARKAL’s convention and divide aviation into “general aviation” and “passenger jets.” Following EPA MARKAL, we assume that in all regions, 99% of capacity and demand is passenger jets, with the remaining 1% allocated to general aviation. As mentioned above, we do not currently model freight aviation. It is estimated that globally, aviation accounts for only [1% of total freight tonnage](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-the-growth-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-commercial-aviation#6). We hope to include freight aviation in a future iteration of the database.\n",

    "EFS does not report freight shipping. As a result, we use the <a href=\"https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/index.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freight Analysis Framework</a> for existing capacity and demand breakdowns. FAF does not distinguish between different vessel types. We use data from the United States Army Corps of Engineers report, [‘Waterborne Transportation Lines of the United States’](https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16021coll2/id/1376/) to estimate the breakdown of freight cargo by vessel type. We assume these fractions remain constant out to 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passenger ferries\n",
    "Neither MARKAL nor EFS report data on passenger ferries. We estimate existing capacity and future demand based on the <a href=\"https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/transit-statistics/public-transportation-fact-book/\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Public Transportation Fact Book (APTFB)</a>. We do not have forecasts for passenger ferry miles traveled, so assume a flat demand out to 2050. According to the APTFB, in 2019, passenger ferries consumed approximately 46 million gallons of diesel fuel. Assuming an energy content of <a href=\"https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/energy-content-d_868.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">139,000 BTU/gallon</a>, ferries in the US only consumed less than 1 quad in 2019. We assume the regional breakdown of demand is identical to that for freight ships. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Passenger rail\n",
    "EFS only reports “passenger rail,” but we model three subcategories: commuter rail, intercity rail, and subways/streetcars. <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=278925\" rel=\"nofollow\">EPA MARKAL</a>, on the other hand, has demand and capacity disaggregated by the three subcategories. The fraction of total passenger rail demand met by each of the three subcategories varies region-to-region, as some regions are more dependent on one mode than the others. We use MARKAL data for existing capacity and demand, rather than EFS, as it is the most disaggregated. While existing capacity is largely drawn from EPA MARKAL, the MARKAL database does not model dual-mode commuter rail locomotives. These locomotives can run on diesel, but switch over to electric power where the infrastructure is available or where local air quality ordinances require it. To estimate the fraction of existing commuter rail that is dual mode, rather than diesel or electric, we use data on annual ridership by region from the <a href=\"https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019-Q4-Ridership-APTA.pdfAmerican\" rel=\"nofollow\">Public Transportation Association</a>. We combine this with estimates of the number of locomotives powered by diesel, electricity, or both from each of the 32 commuter rail lines across the US. This data is largely drawn from the websites of individual transit organizations. While the number of locomotives is not a perfect proxy for the number of passenger miles traveled by each type, we assume it is sufficient as all new capacity will be optimized by the model and this assumption only affects the existing stock.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Off-highway vehicles\n",
    "Currently, off-highway vehicle demand is drawn from EPA MARKAL. We do not represent individual vehicle types, but follow EPA's convention of meeting off-highway demand with two off-highway technologies, off-highway diesel and off-highway gasoline. \n",

Heavy-duty EVSE costs are a weighted average of 50 kW, 150 kW, and 350 kW DCFC chargers. All light-duty capital cost assumptions are drawn from Borlaug et al (2020). To calculate a weighted average capital cost, we draw assumptions on the number of vehicles served by each charger type from a 2021 NREL report. The report finds that as of 2017, each public L2 charger could serve 20 vehicles while each DCFC serves 100 vehicles. We assume that at-home L2 chargers currently only serve a single vehicle. Using the reported capital costs from Borlaug et al. and the number of vehicles per charger, we estimate the average capital cost as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C_{overall}=[\\frac{C_{L2res}}{VMT \\cdot FE \\cdot VPC_{res} }]+[\\frac{C_{L2public}}{VMT \\cdot FE \\cdot VPC_{L2public}}]+[\\frac{C_{DCFC}}{VMT \\cdot FE \\cdot VPC_{DCFC}}]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where VMT is the annual vehicle miles traveled by a light-duty vehicle (assumed to be 11,325 based on EPA MARKAL), FE is the average fuel economy (0.76 billion vehicle miles traveled per PJ), and VPC is the number of vehicles served per charger and Ci are the capital costs for a given charger type. Using base-year VPC assumptions, we obtain a 2020 overall capital cost of 317 \\\\$M/(PJ/year). O&M costs are assumed to be 1\\% of total capital costs, in accordance with Borlaug et al (2020). For years beyond 2020, we assume a higher VPC. The 2021 NREL report estimates that by 2030, each public L2 charger will serve 25 vehicles and each DCFC charger will serve 550 vehicles. We assume a slight increase in vehicles served by L2 home chargers, increasing the VPC from 1 to 1.3. This increased utilization yields a capital cost in 2030 of 205.13 $M/(PJ/year). We assume a linear decrease from 2020 to 2030 and make the assumption that capital costs stay flat from 2030 onward. Under deep decarbonization, it is likely that capital costs will fall and utilization rates will increase, so our values likely represent a conservative estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Far less data exists about heavy-duty charger usage rates and capital costs. Borlaug et al. (2021) estimates the fraction of heavy-duty EVs operating in fleets that could charge using existing electric distribution systems and the fraction needing infrastructure updates, such as transformers, additional substations, and upgrades to feeder circuits. The study also reports estimates for the costs of necessary transmission infrastructure upgrades as well as 50, 150, and 350 kW DCFCs. The authors find that in the fleets studied, the majority of electric substations can supply 100 battery electric trucks with 100 kW per vehicle without additional upgrades. The study also finds that most heavy-duty stations could charge their trucks using typical light-duty chargers (50 kW DCFC) but provides cost estimates for 150 kW and 350 kW DCFCs. While data does not exist on the fraction of fleet owners that will adopt each charger type, we assume that most fleet owners will opt for the least expensive charger type. Specifically, we assume that 75% of substations will be equipped with 50 kW DCFCs, 20% will use 150 kW DCFCs, and the remaining 5% will use 350 kW DCFCs. The paper also reports that approximately 6% of stations need new transformers, 3% need upgraded feeder circuits, 6% need new substations, and 3% need new feeder breakers; we include these estimated retrofit costs in our overall capital estimate. The vehicles in the fleets studied in Borlaug et al.’s analysis were parked for an average of 14 hours per day. Assuming an average energy consumption of 2 kWh mile-1, it would take ~6 hours to charge a truck with a range of 300 miles. We assume, therefore, that each charger could serve 2 trucks during the 14 parked hours. Lastly, Borlaug et al. report that medium-duty and short-haul heavy duty fleets in the US are rarely comprised of more than 100 vehicles, so we assume that each station has 50 plugs (capable of charging 100 vehicles). The total cost (in million USD) of a single station is calculated as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C_{total} = [(FP_{50kW} \\cdot C_{50kW}+FP_{150kW} \\cdot C_{150kW}+FP_{350kW} \\cdot C_{350kW})×PPS]+[FS_{transformer} \\cdot C_{transformer}+FS_{feeder circuit} \\cdot C_{feeder circuit}+FS_{substation} \\cdot C_{substation}+FS_{feeder breaker} \\cdot C_{feeder breaker}]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where FPi is the fraction of plugs at each charging level, PPS is the number of plugs per station,  FSi is the fraction of stations needing each kind of upgrade, and Ci is the cost of each component. We find the average capital cost for a new charging depot to be $8.9 million. Assuming 27,390 vehicle miles traveled per year per vehicle (based on EPA MARKAL) and an average energy consumption of 0.11 PJ per billion vmt, we calculate a capital cost of 17,160 \\\\$M/(PJ/year). As with light-duty EVSE, we assume the O&M costs are 1% of the capital cost.\n",

    "##### Hydrogen Refueling Stations\n",
    "\n",
    "We draw most of our assumptions for hydrogen refueling capital costs from Argonne National Laboratory’s Light- and Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Refueling Station Analysis Models (HRSAM and HDRSAM). The models provide capital and operation & maintenance (O&M) costs for stations with user-specified capacities. While a number of the input parameters (such as storage pressure and temperature and number of compressor stages) may be modified by the user, we use the default values provided in the model spreadsheets. The only parameter we modify is the station capacity. Capacity assumptions and the resulting station costs are detailed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the capital cost of light-duty refueling infrastructure, HRSAM requires a station capacity input [kg H2/day], as station cost does not scale linearly with hydrogen capacity. A 2020 DOE program record reports that the average station capacity for stations operating between 2012 and 2017 was 480 kg/day, but newer planned gaseous H2 stations have average capacities of 770 kg/day. We assume hydrogen refueling stations constructed in 2020 will have a capacity of 480 kg/day, rising to 770 kg/day in 2030, and continuing to increase linearly to 1,350 kg/day in 2050. To calculate capital cost [\\\\$M/(PJ/year)], we divide the cost output from HRSAM [\\\\$M] by the annual station capacity [PJ/year]. Capital costs range from 210.5 \\\\$M/(PJ/year) in 2020 to 95.4 \\\\$M/(PJ/year) in 2050. Fixed operation & maintenance costs also come from HRSAM and range from 13.1 \\\\$M/PJ in 2020 to 6.7 $M/PJ in 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As hydrogen heavy-duty trucks are largely still in the development phase, limited information exists on possible refueling station capacities. One 2019 study evaluating the costs of US hydrogen refueling infrastructure models three capacity levels: 756 kg/day, 3024 kg/day, and 7560 kg/day. Their lower bound estimate is similar to existing capacities for light-duty refueling stations, while the upper bound lines up well with planned future commercial deployment. According to press releases, the FCEV manufacturer, Nikola, plans to develop stations with an 8 ton/day (7257 kg/day) capacity. As such, we assume stations built in 2020 have a 770 kg/day capacity (identical to currently planned light-duty vehicle refueling stations) rising linearly to 7600 kg/day in 2050. Cost estimates are drawn from Argonne National Laboratory’s Heavy-Duty Refueling Station Analysis Model (HDRSAM). Capital costs range from 408.1 \\\\$M/(PJ/year) in 2020 to 104.4 \\\\$M/(PJ/year) in 2050. Fixed costs range from 25.1 \\\\$M/PJ in 2020 to 10.3 \\\\$M/PJ in 2050.\n",
